                    <p class = "abt-me">Hello hello! My name is Luke Arnold, and I'm currently a sophmore at Northwestern University majoring in Computer Science and Theatre. Originally from the Bay Area, I had the opportunity to get involved with computer science early on, and have been in love ever since. I get easily excited about cool ideas, and can often be found standing on tables, chairs, or anything else that's not the ground when brainstorming and planning projects. I'm a big fan of interesting tech (and human achievement in general), and love watching video essays in my spare time. </p>
                    <p class = "abt-me">I primarily work in Python and C/C++, and am especialy interested in the ways that computers/technology can be used to extend and enhance human ability. Outside of personally coding, I do a lot of work with kids ages 5-12, and have developed a strong appreciation for unorthodox approaches and perspectives, as well as a deep respect for boundless curiosity. You always think you understand something until you try to explain it to a five year old!</p>
